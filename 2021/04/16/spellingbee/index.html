After the euphoria, there was a lot of pressure. After a long preparation, the day of the game finally arrived. Here, the competition has long been called “the match between China and the United States.”It goes without saying that Cambridge has never won China or the US since the tournament began. With such a heavy burden on our shoulders, we stepped onto the stage with nervous and mixed feelings. This is a grade credibility game, we want to do our best, not the best. In the short but long one hour, Cambridge students, who were behind by 40 points, did not give up and turned the tide in adversity. Finally, they surpassed China and the United States by more than 200 points and won the first champion of Cambridge class since the beginning of the competition.</span></a></li><li class="nav-item nav-level-3"><a class="nav-link" href="#I%E2%80%99ve-had-my-first-one-but-this-one-is-different-The-audience-from-the-original-full-of-expectations-to-bow-the-head-sigh-and-from-the-hope-to-see-the-final-back-to-exceed-the-score-of-cheering-caper-After-this-match-I-deeply-realized-the-importance-of-teamwork-and-the-necessity-of-preparation-before-the-match-Then-there-is-the-power-of-confidence-As-the-motto-of-Harvard-says-%E2%80%9CEvery-great-miracle-begins-with-the-power-of-faith-%E2%80%9DIn-the-sea-of-life-there-is-no-ship-without-injury"><span class="nav-number">3.</span> <span class="nav-text">I’ve had my first one, but this one is different.

The moment you choose the International Department, you need to realize that your vocabulary will be three times or more than that of your classmates in the general high school. Therefore, daily accumulation is very important. Words can not deliberately recite, to find more in life, more practice. Personally, I can say that 3 to 40 percent of my vocabulary comes from American TV series, movies and music. Therefore, taking a look after learning can not only relieve the pressure of study, but also greatly enhance the vocabulary and language sense.
